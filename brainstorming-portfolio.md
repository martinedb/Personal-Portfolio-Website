### List of Things To Address for Personal Portfolio

1. Finalizing the backend for the contact form so that I actually receive responses.
2. Addressing issues with the modal window not opening properly (it veers off to the side still and requires vertical and horizontal scrolling). 
3. Ensuring that dark mode applies to all sections of the website and that the text is readable in dark mode.
